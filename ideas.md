*** blunt: declarative 
================================
(namkyu, 3/6)

a code poem is not poetry because of its code or its apis: it is a code poem because of what it is in its totality; in its whole affectation on the person who interprets it: it stays blown up, as a big thing - they work on two different scalar planes

code is infrastructure: code poetry - interpret it as a creative engineering - it works on a different scale. Code poetry is the "back-end": the computer voice

blunt, honest, pretzel-looping language: best executed, most honestly translated 

its dialectical nature is why it's such a difficult thing: they're antithetical in so many ways

everyone learns the same "hello world" in the beginning: but something 

we assume code can be poetry, and poetry can be code: that these are truths. 

"hello world" - our manifesto about code poetry and what it can be. this is a conversation we had. we believe in this. it's an extension of what we believe about poetry, code, information, computers.. the world.. 

we're just all too afraid of looking at our own source code 

just for. just for loops

*** anatomy of a bad habit 
--------------------------

void do( abadhabit ) {

while (true) {

  abadhabit++ ; 
  
}
}

do(biteyournails); 

do(keepquietinprecept); 

do(stalkher); 


dont(stop); 

similar to a program that destroys itself - 
ends in something that's just quietly sad: 
bye
